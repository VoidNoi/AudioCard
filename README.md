# AudioCard
Audio player for the Cardputer

Place your audios or folders inside the `AudioCard` folder on your SD card

It technically supports mp3, aac, flac and opus but I've only tested it with mp3

## Controls
- Change the volume by pressing the `up` or `down` keys (aka `;` or `.`)
- Change the song by pressing the `left` or `right` keys (aka `,` or `/`)
- Pause/Play a song by pressing `enter`
- Stop the song and go back to the menu with `esc` key
- Go back to the menu without stopping the song with `del`
